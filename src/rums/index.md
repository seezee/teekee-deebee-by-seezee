# Rum Categories
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD025 -->

## Definitions

Lightly aged
  : 1 to 4 years old, with limited wood influence. Charcoal filtration may have removed some color while allowing some wood character to remain.

Aged
  : 5 to 14 years old with definite and noticeable oak influence. Spice, vanilla, leather, and woody notes develop. Some older rums produced by the solera method are included.

Long aged
  : 15 or more years old and best enjoyed neat. The depth and subtlety of these rums may be lost in a complex mixed drink.
