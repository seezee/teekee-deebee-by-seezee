[^1]: Founded in 1989 by Maison Ferrand, Plantation Rum changed its name to Plantaray in <time datetime="2024">2024</time> to avoid the hurtful connotation "plantation" has acquired due to its association with slavery.

    Not all Plantaray rums belong in this category, e.g., Plantaray Xaymaca is [pot still lightly aged](/rums/01-rum-pot-still-lightly-aged/)<icon-l space="1em" class="bigger" label="(1)"><span class="with-icon"><svg class="icon"><use href="/assets/images/icons/circle-1.svg#circle-1"></use></svg></span></icon-l>.
