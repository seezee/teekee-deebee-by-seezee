  <tiki-callout type="note">

    Many of the recipes call for a <a href="/rums" >rum category</a> followed by a numbered icon, based on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Smugglers-Cove-Exotic-Cocktails-Cult/dp/1607747324/">Martin Cate’s rum taxonomy</a>.

    Cate recommends you affix tape or DYMO-style labels with corresponding numbers to the necks of your rum bottles for a quick visual reference.

  <!-- Do not indent  nested callout further -->

  <stack-l>
    <tiki-callout type="tip">

      To search for a rum by its category number, type the number surrounded by brackets, e.g. type `[2]` to search for recipes calling for blended lightly aged rums.
