<span class="small-caps">Oh, hello</span>. You look parched. Why don&rsquo;t you pull up a kilderkin[^1], sit down, and wet your whistle? The best place to start is by searching for a drink. You can search by:

[^1]: A barrel with a capacity of 82 litres / 22 U.S. gallons / 18 Imperial gallons. A kilderkin is half the size of a British brewery barrel.

In the mood for almond? Type "orgeat." Thirsty for a highball? Type "tall" or "highball." Looking for something bubbly? Try typing "spritz" or "cooler." Want a strained drink in a stemmed glass? Give "coupe" a whirl. Hate it when the gentle tropical rains dilute your drink? Type "umbrella." Craving something from the master's secret recipe books? Type "Don the Beachcomber." Yearning for something from Tiki's earliest days? Type "1930."

Desktop users, type <kbd>⌘</kbd>&#8239;+&#8239;<kbd>K</kbd> to get started (mobile users, tap the search bar and enter your query)!

{% callout "note" %}

  Many of the recipes call for a <a href="/rums" >rum category</a> followed by a numbered icon, based on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Smugglers-Cove-Exotic-Cocktails-Cult/dp/1607747324/">Martin Cate’s rum taxonomy</a>.

  Cate recommends you affix tape or DYMO-style labels with corresponding numbers to the necks of your rum bottles for a quick visual reference.

    {% callout "tip" %}

      To search for a rum by its category number, type the number surrounded by parentheses, e.g. type `(2)` to search for recipes calling for blended lightly aged rums.
