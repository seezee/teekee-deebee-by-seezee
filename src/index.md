  <span class="small-caps">Oh, hello</span>. You look parched. Why don&rsquo;t you pull up a rum barrel, sit down, and wet your whistle? The best place to start is by searching for drink by name, type, characteristic, base spirit, ingredient, garnish, or glassware. Type <kbd>⌘</kbd>&#8239;+&#8239;<kbd>K</kbd> to get started!

{% callout "note" %}

  Many of the recipes call for a <a href="/rums" >rum category</a> followed by a numbered icon, based on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Smugglers-Cove-Exotic-Cocktails-Cult/dp/1607747324/">Martin Cate’s rum taxonomy</a>.

  Cate recommends you affix tape or DYMO-style labels with corresponding numbers to the necks of your rum bottles for a quick visual reference.

  <stack-l>
    {% callout "tip" %}

      To search for a rum by its category number, type the number surrounded by parentheses, e.g. type `(2)` to search for recipes calling for blended lightly aged rums.
