2. Dissolve granulated sugar in the water, stirring with a whisk or immersion blender, about 1 minute
3. Immediately remove from heat & allow to cool

  To make Donn's Mix, combine 2 parts fresh white grapefruit juice to 1 part cinnamon syrup.

  If you can't find white grapefruit, use pink. Use red grapefruit juice only as a last resort.
