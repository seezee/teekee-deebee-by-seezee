<tiki-callout type="tip">

  The recipes for coffee grog batter and pearl diver mix are identical; however, pearl diver mix must be used at room temperature to prevent it sticking to the drink mixing tin.
  
  Make the latter shortly before using it, or bring it to room temperature before deploying.

  <p>Note the expiration date on the butter before making this mixture. The batter will keep, sealed and refrigerated, until that date.</p>
  
  <p>You may also store frozen in a freezer bag (remove as much air from the bag as possible before sealing). Allow to thaw partially before using.</p>
