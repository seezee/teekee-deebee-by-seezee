## Ingredients

* 225 grams <span data-pagefind-filter="Ingredient">blanched <span data-pagefind-filter="Ingredient">almonds</span></span>
* 500 milliliters water
* 562.5 grams granulated sugar (approximately; see step 11)
* &frac18; teaspoons <span data-pagefind-filter="Ingredient">rose water</span>
* &frac18; teaspoons <span data-pagefind-filter="Ingredient">orange flower water</span>
* 1 teaspoon [column still lightly aged rum](/rums/07-rum-column-still-lightly-aged/)

## Instructions

1. Add almonds & water to a large pot & bring to a boil over high heat
2. Strain almonds and set aside in a large mixing bowl, batter bowl, or measuring cup, **reserving liquid** in a separate bowl or cup
3. Using the steel blade of a food processor, grind about half of the boiled almonds  into rice-sized pieces, about 10 seconds
4. Slowly add about a half of the almond liquid to the food processor & blend into a paste,[^1] about 10 seconds
5. Pour contents into a pitcher, at least &frac12; gallon sized
6. Repeat with the remaining ingredients
7. Let mixture cool for 1 hour
8. Strain through a fine mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth over a 2-quart pot: in batches
9. In batches, squeeze as much liquid as is practical from the remaining almond paste through a piece of cheese cloth into the pot
10. Set the fine-mesh strainer lined with new cheesecloth over a 2-cup glass measuring cup and pour the strained liquid through it
11. Measure twice as much sugar as the almond milk yield and add to the pot
12. Whisk over low heat until sugar is dissolved, creating a thick syrup, about 15 minutes
13. Taste for grittiness; if the sugar is not dissolved, continue heating and stirring
14. Remove from heat & allow to cool
15. Stir in the rose water & orange flower water
16. Stir periodically as the syrup cools
17. Once the orgeat is room temperature, strain through a cheesecloth lined funnel into a sealed container and refrigerate

[^1]: About the consistency of Cream of Wheat or watery oatmeal.
