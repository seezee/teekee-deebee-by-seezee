  Smuggler's Cove notes that Trinidad only started producing rum in large quantities after World War II. Even though this drink has Trinidadian origins, they recommend a [black blended rum](/rums/11-rum-black-blended/)<icon-l space="1em" class="bigger" label="(5)"><span class="with-icon"><svg class="icon"><use href="/assets/images/icons/circle-5.svg#circle-5"></use></svg></span></icon-l><span class="after-icon"></span>as being the likely choice at the time the drink was first formulated.
