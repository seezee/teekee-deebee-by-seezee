  Jeff Berry notes that Donn Beach made this drink with a 20-year-old Cuban rum called Infierno, long extinct.

  Berry also suggests alternate glassware, a kind of short, heavy footed goblet, which he pictures on p. 89 of <cite>{{ source }}</cite>, 10<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Expanded Edition (2017).
