[^1]: In 1995, Adam Segar, bartender and beverage manager at the Seelbach Hilton Hotel in Louisville, Kentucky created this now popular cocktail. He also concocted a story about how he found it in a 1917 Seelbach menu, claiming it was the hotel's signature cocktail.

    The story fooled many people, including Gary "Gaz" Regan and Mardee Haiden Regan, who included it in <cite>New Classic Cocktails</cite> (1997), and Ted Haigh, who published it in <cite>Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails</cite> (2009).

    Segar eventually confessed his deception to Regan. Some time after, Robert Simonson debunked the story in his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/02/dining/seelbach-cocktail-louisville-fake.html" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">16 October 2016</a> <cite>New York Times</cite> drinks column.
