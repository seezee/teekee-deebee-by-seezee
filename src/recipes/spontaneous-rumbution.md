  Fire is dramatic, but also dangerous. Do not serve fire if you or your guests are not reasonably sober. Give fair warning to your guests that you will be setting the drink ablaze and advise everyone to keep themselves and any flammables on their persons (hair, scarves, and so forth) at a safe distance.

  Practice this drinks's technique before entertaining guests. Keep a fire extinguisher handy and ensure that the area around the drink making space is free of flammable materials. An outdoor concrete or brick patio on a calm day makes an ideal practice space.
