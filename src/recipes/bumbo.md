## Ingredients

* 1/4 ounce [rich Demerara syrup](/mixes/2-1-simple-syrup)
* 2 ounces [blended aged rum](/rums/05-rum-blended-aged/)<icon-l space="1em" class="bigger" label="(3)"><span class="with-icon"><svg class="icon"><use href="/assets/images/icons/circle-3.svg#circle-3"></use></svg></span></icon-l>

Garnish
  : Freshly grated nutmeg

## Instructions

1. Stir the rum and syrup in a mixing glass[^2]
2. Strain into an ice-filled old-fashioned glass
3. Top with freshly grated nutmeg

[^2]: It's not clear from the Smuggler's Cove recipe whether the mixing glass should contain ice, but the next step suggests it should. Otherwise, why strain it? Why not simply build it in the rocks glass?

    Then again, this drink was originally made entirely without ice, and sometimes served hot. So perhaps not?

<tiki-callout type="tip">

  For an eighteenth century take on this drink, substitute pot still unaged rum or pot still lightly aged rum.
