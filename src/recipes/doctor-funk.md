origin: <stack-l><p>Unlike the bulk of classic tiki drinks, which were invented by white men in California, this recipe actually originated in Polynesia. Doctor Bernard Funk was a German-born physician practicing medicine in Samoa's capital city, Apia. While in Samoa, Funk befriended <cite>Treasure Island</cite> author Robert Louis Stevenson; eventually he served as the writer's bedside doctor when Stevenson died in 1894.</p><p>Funk concocted a medicinal tonic comprising <q>a portion of absinthe, a dash of grenadine – a syrup of the pomegranate fruit, the juice of two limes, and half a pint of siphon water,</q> which eventually became notorious throughout the region. Travel writer Frederick O’Brien (1869&#8288;&thinsp;&#8288;–&#8288;&thinsp;&#8288;1932) mentions it in his books <cite>White Shadows in the South Seas</cite> (1919) and <cite>Mystic Isles of the South Seas</cite> (1921).</p><p>Don the Beachcomber created multiple Doctor Funk recipes beginning in the 1930s and continuing through the 1940s; Trader Vic had his own versions as well. As other restaurants copied and tweaked the recipe, they often changed the name; the Doctor Fong and Doctor Wong being two examples (see note).</p><p>The following recipe is based on Victor Bergeron's 1947 version.</p></stack-l>

  The Luau in Hollywood's spin on Doctor Funk was Doctor Wong.

  Jeff "Beachbum" Berry records the 1957 version of Doctor Wong in <cite>Sippin&rsquo; Safari</cite> (2007):

* 1/2 ounce fresh lime juice
* 1/2 ounce tonga mix[^1]
* 1 teaspoon Herbsaint or Pernod
* 1 ounce white rum (blended lightly aged<icon-l space="1em" class="bigger" label="(2)"><span class="with-icon"><svg class="icon"><use href="/assets/images/icons/circle-2.svg#circle-2"></use></svg></span></icon-l><span class="after-icon"></span>or column still lightly aged rum)
* 3 ounces crushed ice

[^1]: To make tonga mix, combine 4 parts grenadine to 1 part passion fruit juice (<em>not</em> passion fruit syrup).

1. Place all ingredients in a blender; put the ice in last
2. Blend at high speed for up to 5 seconds
3. Pour into a footed pilsner glass
4. Top with more crushed ice
