<tiki-callout type="tip">

  According to Jeff Berry, Donn often used a Louisiana rum, especially a rum called Pontalba,[^2] in his early recipes. Berry recommends New Orleans-based Celebration Distillation's Old New Orleans Amber in this and Donn's other recipes calling for Pontalba.

[^2]: Don't confuse this with the contemporary Puerto Rican rum of the same name.
