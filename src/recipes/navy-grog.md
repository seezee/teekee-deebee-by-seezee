origin: <stack-l><p>During tiki's peak, purveyors of tropical drinks faced a marketing problem&colon; the perception among their male clientele that fruity rum drinks weren't "manly." Their solution was to concoct strong drinks branded as "grogs" and tout them as masculine tipples drunk by sailors of yore. Apart from the name, these drinks bore little resemblance to historical grogs.</p><p>Don the Beachcomber invented the Navy Grog, but it's Trader Vic's version that gained fame, partly because of its infamous adherents. Among these were Richard Nixon (a former Navy man) and Phil Spector (who drank two Navy Grogs the night he murdered Lana Clarkson).</p></stack-l>

  To make Don the Beachcomber's (1941) version of the Navy Grog, substitute 1 ounce honey syrup and 3/4 ounce seltzer for the Demerara syrup and allspice dram. Strain the drink over an ice cone placed in a double old-fashioned glass.
