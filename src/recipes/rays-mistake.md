Garnish
  : Pineapple wedge
  : Maraschino cherry
  : Cocktail pick

## Instructions

1. Add all ingredients *except* black blended rum to a drink mixer tin filled with 12 ounces crushed ice + 4 to 6 small ice cubes
2. Flash blend 3 to 4 seconds
3. Open pour with gated finish into a Collins or zombie glass
4. Float black blended rum on top [^1]
5. Spear a pineapple wedge and a maraschino cherry on a cocktail spear and garnish

[^1]: You may employ the pousse-café technique of pouring the rum over the back of a spoon to make this easier.

  Be sure to serve this with an straw lest you (or your guest) taste nothing but the float. Tiki-Ti uses an oversized specimen: the pink straws Braum's restaurants serve with their malts and shakes seem purpose-made for this potion.

  Tiki-Ti uses "bottom-shelf" white rum (Barton, U.S. Virgin Islands) for the base and Coruba dark rum for the float. If you can't get your hands on Coruba, mix 3 parts Gosling's Black Seal to 1 part Smith & Cross to approximate Coruba's flavor and aroma.
