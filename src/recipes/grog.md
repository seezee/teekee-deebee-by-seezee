<tiki-callout type="note">

 To mimic a grog from the 1700s, use [pot still unaged rum](/rums/00-rum-pot-still-unaged/) or [black pot still rum](/rums/10-rum-black-pot-still/), skipping the ice. No need to use a dirty glass or dilute with brackish water.

 For a nineteenth-century-style grog, use [black pot still rum](/rums/10-rum-black-pot-still/) rum.

 Smuggler's Cove eschews historical authenticity by using [blended aged rum](/rums/05-rum-blended-aged/)<icon-l space="1em" class="bigger" label="(3)"><span class="with-icon"><svg class="icon"><use href="/assets/images/icons/circle-3.svg#circle-3"></use></svg></span></icon-l>.<span class="after-icon"></span>Who are we to argue with them?
