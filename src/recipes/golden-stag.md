<tiki-callout type="note">

  According to Jeff Berry, this recipe specified Golden Stag (an extinct gold Jamaican rum) for the pot still unaged rum, dark Jamaican rum for the black blended rum, and Pontalba[^1] (a now extinct Louisiana rum) for the blended aged rum.
  
  Berry recommends you substitute any gold Jamaican rum for the Golden Stag and  New Orleans-based Celebration Distillation's Old New Orleans Amber for the Pontalba.

[^1]: Don't confuse this with the contemporary Puerto Rican rum of the same name.
