## Instructions

```text
  Let ɑ = Ingredient amount for 1 individual serving
  Let β = Guests quantity
  Let ɣ = Teetotalers quantity
  Let δ = Total ingredient amount for final pre-batched punch

  For each ingredient, δ = 1.5 × ɑ × (β - ɣ)
```

1. Determine the number of guests expected to drink; multiply by 1.5
2. Multiply ingredient quantities by the result of step 1
3. Combine all ingredients in a beverage dispenser or other sealable container and whisk together
4. Chill for at least an hour prior to guests arriving
5. Add a large block of ice to the dispenser if using, or pour the contents of the container into a punch bowl and add a smaller block of ice[^1]
6. If using a punch bowl, serve with a ladle
7. Garnish individual servings with a mint sprig and serve with a smile
