Jeff "Beachbum" Berry had to tinker with this recipe quite a bit to make something drinkable and historically accurate. The original recipe was short on details, calling for 1/2 ounce lime, 1/4 ounce Markeza (Donn Beach's code for passion fruit syrup), 1 ounce Myer's [sic] Jamaican, a piece of pineapple, and 1 teaspoon of honey, with no instructions on how to prepare.

In 1937 the Myers's rum was probably their Light Vatted, a (now extinct) lightly aged Jamaican rum, so Berry recommends something similar, at least 86 proof.
