## Instructions

1. Add all ingredients + 12 ounces of crushed ice + 4 to 6 small ice cubes to a drink mixer tin
2. Flash blend 3 to 4 seconds
3. Open pour into a hollowed-out pineapple
4. Close the pineapple with the lid and insert two straws, unless making a mermaid island (see note)

### Mermaid Island

  To make a mermaid island: rather than cutting out the pineapple core, leave it in place to create a small island, then top it with a cocktail umbrella and a plastic mermaid. Discard the pineapple lid.

  Jeff Berry's published recipe serves one person, but if you're going to go to the trouble of hollowing out a pineapple, we think you should double the recipe and share it with a friend.
