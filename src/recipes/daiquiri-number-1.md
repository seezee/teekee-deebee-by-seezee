The various printings of <cite><a href="https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1935-Bar-la-Florida-Cocktails" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">{{ source }}</a></cite> presented the recipes in Spanish on the left side of each page, with the English translation to the right. The translation introduced numerous errors, most notably translating <span lang="es">limón verde</span> (lime; literally "green lemon") as <q>lemon.</q>
