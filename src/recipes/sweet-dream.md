<tiki-callout type="note">

  Although the original recipe calls for white Puerto Rican rum (suggesting we should be using column still lightly aged rum), we follow Smuggler's Cove's house style. Use category <icon-l space="1em" class="bigger" label="(3)"><span class="with-icon"><svg class="icon"><use href="/assets/images/icons/circle-3.svg#circle-3"></use></svg></span></icon-l><span class="after-icon"></span> rum in this recipe. In Martin Cove's words:

  <q>[We] believe that a blended lightly aged rum with a hint more body better captures a more historic taste profile.</q>

 Teenaged Hank went without sugar while he slept in the jungle for three months during WWII[^1]. Jeff Berry speculates that this may account for this drink's name.
