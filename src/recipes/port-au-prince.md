<tiki-callout type="note">

  The original recipe for this drink called for Rhum Sarthe (an extinct Haitian rum) and Pontalba (an extinct Louisiana rum).

  Jeff Berry's version specifies 3/4&nbsp;ounce [cane coffey still aged rum](/rums/00-rhum-cane-coffey-still-aged/) and 3/4&nbsp;ounce Celebration Distillation Old New Orleans Amber. It's worth noting that the latter is produced in small quantities and is not widely distributed.
