origin: <stack-l><p>Trader Vic invented this classic in 1944, although Don the Beachcomber claims it was merely a copy of his Q.B. Cooler. Don also claimed to have invented the mai tai, but in 1970 an out-of-court settlement awarded the naming rights to Vic.</p><p>According to legend, Vic was entertaining two friends from Tahiti, Ham and Carrie Guild, when he concocted the recipe. When Carrie sipped the elixir, she exclaimed <q>Maita'i Roe A'e</q> (<q>Out of this World&thinsp;—&thinsp;The Best</q>), giving the drink its moniker.</p>

## Instructions

1. Squeeze the lime halves over a jigger with a jaw-style citrus squeezer; reserve one of the spent lime shells
2. Add all ingredients + 12 ounces crushed ice + a few small cubes to a cocktail shaker
3. Shake until frost forms on the shaker, about 15 to 20 seconds
4. Pour entire contents into a mai tai or double old-fashioned glass
5. Garnish with a mint sprig and one of the spent lime shells

  Use a jaw-style citrus squeezer such as a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Winco-LS-3-Lemon-Lime-Squeezer/dp/B000HVQCKY" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Winco LS-3</a> to extract the lime juice; this type of squeezer also extracts citrus oil from the fruit's rind into the drink.

  The closest rum today to the original 17-year-old Wray & Nephew used by Trader Vic is Denizen Merchant's Reserve. Smuggler's Cove uses this rum in their mai tais exclusively.

  According to Trader Vic, the garnish should resemble a little island with a minty palm tree, floating peacefully in a sea of rum.
