origin: <stack-l><p>Conventional wisdom (and some contemporary accounts) say this drink was invented by Ngiam Tong Boon while he worked as a bartender at Singapore's Raffles Hotel; the drink is likely a riff on the popular gin sling, itself a descendant of the gin Collins.</p><p>Based on a reference to a <q>pink sling</q> in a 1903 Singapore newspaper, the Singapore Sling is likely to have been invented around that year (the Raffles bar claims it was invented in 1915, the year Boon died). However, David Wondrich claims that the drink <a href="https://www.esquire.com/food-drink/drinks/a9663/authentic-cocktail-recipes-0411/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">was created in the 1890s</a> and wasn't related to the Raffles until the 1920s.</p><p>The drink is also sometimes called the Raffles Hotel Sling or the Straights Sling.</p></stack-l>

  Trader Vic printed four sling recipes in his 1947 Bartender's Guide. These include the Raffles Hotel Sling, Singapore Sling N<sup>o.</sup> 1, Singapore Sling N<sup>o.</sup> 2, and the Gin Sling. Each of these recipes is quite different from the version printed here.

  Many early recipes call for this drink to be garnished with a "horse's neck," a long spiral lime peel with one end left hanging over the rim of the glass.
