origin: Charles H. Baker Jr. credits this Prohibition-era recipe to one Wil P. Taylor in an anecdote that involves the <q>near blast[ing of] a marvellous [sic.] hotel off the map, to get at those Machado-phile officers hiding there.</q> Gerardo Machado was a general of the Cuban War of Independence and President of Cuba from 1925 to 1933. Baker first published the recipe in 1939.
