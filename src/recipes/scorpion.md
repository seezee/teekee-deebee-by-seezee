He revised the recipe for single portions in the 1972 <cite>Trader Vic's Bartender's Guide</cite> reprint, omitting the gin and wine.<p><p>When Steve Crane, owner of the Luau in Beverly Hills, adapted the recipe in 1958 he swapped out the lemon juice in Trader Vic's recipe for lime juice and also dropped the white wine.</p></stack-l>

> I’ll never forget a very beautiful form of gentle anesthesia served one night at a luau up in Manoa Valley in Honolulu&NoBreak;&thinsp;&NoBreak;…&NoBreak;&thinsp;&NoBreak;. The object of greatest interest was a tremendous Chinese earthen crock which easily held twenty gallons of punch. In it our host had prepared Honolulu’s famous Scorpion, a drink which does not shilly-shally or mess around in getting you under way.

  Fire is dramatic, but also dangerous. Do not serve fire if you or your guests are not reasonably sober. Give fair warning to your guests that you will be setting the drink ablaze and advise everyone to keep themselves and any flammables on their persons (hair, scarves, and so forth) at a safe distance.

  Guests should blow out the burning crouton(s) before sipping. Use tongs to handle the burnt crouton and extinguish it in a container of water.
